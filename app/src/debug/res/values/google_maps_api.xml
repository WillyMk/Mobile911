    TODO: Before you run your application, you need a Google Maps API key.

    To get one, follow this link, follow the directions and press "Create" at the end:

    You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using these values:

    Package name:
    com.WillyFisky.mobile911

    SHA-1 certificate fingerprint:
    4A:26:C6:C3:29:30:1F:5B:17:D9:26:A3:8E:B2:44:90:10:32:36:BC

    Alternatively, follow the directions here:
